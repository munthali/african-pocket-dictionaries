AFRICAN POCKET DICTIONARIES
===========================

What do you do when you want to find the meaning of a word? Back in the day you'd pick up a dictionary and look through it.

Things have changed. Very few people have hardcopies of dictionaries. These days we open up the browsers on our phones or computers. Say the word you're looking for is "madyondza", you'd go "madyondza meaning" or "madyondza define". Unfortunately, your search results would not provide anything useful in this particular instance.

This is the case for many African and minority languages. While most search engines will allow you to ask for the meaning of any English, French or German word, such functionality has not been built in for our African languages, with the exception of Zulu, Swahili, Yoruba and perhaps a few other dominant African languages. 

While Google Translate happens to be the most widely used translator, I can count with my two hands the number of African languages for which it caters. A language that is not searchable will not stay in use, let alone grow. It will only decay. 

Let's build an application that will allow anyone to search for meanings of words starting with the Xitsonga language. As the project grows, we will incorporate even more languages. 
Come join us for these exciting times in the history of the world!
